# Time-Series-Prediction-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
The dataset for stock price prediction was downloaded from the Yahoo Finance webpage. The stock price prediction was tried for
six different companies three days in advance using recurrent neural networks. 
The MIT-BIH dataset was used for heartbeat anomaly detection. First recurrent neural network classified heartbeat signals into classes 
with or without anomalies. The second recurrent neural network detected type of anomaly in a heartbeat signal and performed multiclass classification.
